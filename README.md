# Project-GrubDash-_Qualified-Kelvin_Saldana
This project tested my ability to build APIs with complex validation. While someone worked on the front-end of this project, I created the back-end that demostrated:
1. Running tests from the command line
2. Using common middleware packages
3. Receiving requests through routes
4. Accessing relevant information through route parameters
5. Building an API following RESTful design principles
6. Writing custom middleware functions
7. Writing basic CRUD applications
